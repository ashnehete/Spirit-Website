        <strong style="font-size: 24px">SPIRIT</strong> was first organized in the year 2007 by the Sports Council of
        SPCE-SPIT to revive the city's engineering
        college sports and thereafter it has only got bigger every year. This year, as we completed decade of keeping
        the SPIRIT alive, we plan to make it bigger than ever before, by organizing a Mini-Marathon: the SP-Marathon
        2017. We will be having colleges from Mumbai, Pune and Nasik to show their skills and strength in 15 different
        sports events.<br>
        It's one of the biggest Sports Festival happening across the Engineering colleges in Mumbai providing an
        opportunity for the cityâ€Ÿs best Sports talents to showcase their skills. SPIRIT experiences not only engineering
        but also colleges from Arts, Commerce, Law and Management backgrounds.
        Keeping the SPIRIT of the game alive, around 1400 athletes will exhibit their grit and hard work during the 9
        day long festival which has always had an overwhelming crowd to support them. This year, to empower our
        initiative of Mini Marathon for a social cause, we are expecting 500+ athletes including students, teachers and
        even senior citizens which would turn our intentions into a big success.
